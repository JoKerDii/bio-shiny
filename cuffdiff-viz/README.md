# CuffDiff Visualizer

This app is designed to visualize differential expression analysis results from CuffDiff. The required inputs are "gene_exp.diff" and "genes.read_group_tracking" files.

When the users CuffDiff results have not been uploaded, the figures and tables are generated by default using CuffDiff outputs from RNAseq datasets in two conditions. Uploading large files may take a long time or get the server stuck, one solution is to clone the repo and run this app locally with users CuffDiff results. 

This app has not been test on any other valid input files, so any feedback or suggestions would be appreciated.

This app is developed and deployed using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). Run it on [remote host](https://jokerdii.shinyapps.io/cuffdiff-viz/).
