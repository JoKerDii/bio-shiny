# Ballgown Visualizer

This application is designed to visualize data information and differential analysis results (specifically HISAT2-StringTie-Ballgown pipeline) in one step on browser. It takes a well-indexed gown object generated by [Ballgown](https://github.com/alyssafrazee/ballgown) (a R/Bioconductor package) as input, and output figures and table summarized on a local website.

This app is developed using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). It cannot be deployed on cloud for now due to Bioconductor package issue, but can be easily used by inputting a well-indexed gown object and running:

```R
options(shiny.autoreload = TRUE)
shiny::runApp()
```
