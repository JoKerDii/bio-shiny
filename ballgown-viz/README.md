# Ballgown Visualizer

This application is designed to visualize data information and differential analysis results (specifically HISAT2-StringTie-Ballgown pipeline) in one step on browser. It takes a well-indexed gown object generated by [Ballgown](https://github.com/alyssafrazee/ballgown) (a R/Bioconductor package) as input, and output figures and table summarized on a local website.

This app is developed using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). Run it on [remote host](https://jokerdii.shinyapps.io/ballgown-viz/).
