# DAVID Gene Ontology Visualizer



A visualization web app taking downloaded GO analysis results "data/chart.txt" and "table.txt" from [DAVID website](https://david.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp) as inputs to show biological functions of enriched genes within peaks found by [exomePeak2](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/exomePeak2.html) R/Bioconductor package.

Run the app on [remote host](https://jokerdii.shinyapps.io/david-viz/).
